# Git commands cheat-sheet: the most useful git commands

## 1. Navigate to your git project folder

Use `cd` to move between folders. For example:

```
cd workspace
cd bdl02_markopacak_git_cheatsheet
```

## 2. Check the status of the project

I can use these commands **anytime** to inspect my project.

- `git status`

    With `git status` I can see if some changes have happened and if some files are ready to be committed. 
    It gives me an overview of the project at that specific moment in time.
- `git log`
- `git diff`

## 3. Initialize a git project 

If any `git` command that we run gives the following output:

> fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

it means that **we are not inside a git project**.

In this case we can:

1. Make sure that we are inside the right folder (and navigate to it, if necessary)
2. Initialize a git project

To initialize git, run 

```
git init
``` 

This command creates an empty Git repository. From now on, we can make changes to our files and permanently save those changes.
